## Start Software Development without the Software

The digital world and the capabilities of software are enchanting. Many new business visions of today utilize software in some significant form. And yet, one of the lessons of Digital Literacy for Decision Makers explicitly emphasizes that software development begins well before any software is actually built.

Software is complex, expensive, and inflexible at times. Even though many other Digital Literacy lessons teach the best practices of making software less difficult and expensive to change, we first want to ask, "What can be done before building software?"

First, we validate assumptions towards the goal of achieving product-market fit. Our initial assumptions or hypotheses about the market, product, customers, or other critical variables, may be inaccurate. Following the build-measure-learn cycle, we iterate on ideas and assumptions with the minimum cycle time possible that still allows us to effectively achieve each step. With larger amounts of business, market, product, or other uncertainties, we will need to iterate through the build-measure-learn cycle more times.

Second, we should ensure that we looking at the problem space independently of the solution space, and base a definition of the solution space upon how we first define the problem space. Some pertinent questions to ask could include the following:

*Problem space*
- Does somebody have a big enough problem?
- Do they want this problem solved?

*Solution space*
- How are they solving the problem now?
- How can you add or enable a solution to this problem?
As the potential solutions are being refined, we come back to the idea of the build-measure-learn cycle and validating assumptions.

Third, then, is the lesson that we can validate hypotheses in a variety of ways. One method is through user research (e.g. focus groups, surveys, observation, interviews), and another is through creating of a minimum viable product. Despite the draw of building a "perfect" solution, the MVP approach is incredibly valuable and can take forms such as a lightweight prototype, email-first startup, Wizard of Oz MVP, among other forms. Dropbox provides a compelling [case study](http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/19/dropbox-minimal-viable-product/) for the value of an MVP.

Finally, we take away two other key lessons to keep in mind throughout pre-development phase of software development:
1. [Build solutions that are painkillers not vitamins](http://www.forbes.com/sites/georgedeeb/2014/07/24/is-your-startup-building-a-vitamin-or-a-painkiller/)
2. [Do things that don't scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html) as advised by Paul Graham, co-founder of Y-Combinator

By beginning software development with the desire to deepen understanding of the market, customers, specific problem, and other core assumptions, the eventual solutions will be significantly more powerful to their end users. The build-measure-learn cycle emphasizes the continuity and repeatedness of this study, and one that continues even once the software build commences.
