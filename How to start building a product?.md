One of my key-takeaways from the class was to understand how to think about an online product. A product essentially is an amalgamation of features and when building a product, it is good to write down all the features that you want to have in that specific product. At a very simple level, an e-commerce platform (the example we did in class) is an amalgamation of features like log in page, lists, selection, basket, checkout page, payments, confirmation, reviews etc. An online small business lender could be an amalgamation of features like login page, information, application, document submission, references, signature etc. 

To start building a product, its important to think about the target customer and how the target customer would use that specific product. This helps in figuring out what is the best way to create that product – website, mobile device optimized site or app (platform). Its also important to consider the available budget and the time in which the product has to be released. A wesbite would take the least amount of time and budget to build whereas an app might take the most amount of time and money. Websites are also easy to upgrade, compatible with most devices, can be found easily (by customer) and also have a wider reach. Apps are more interactive, more customized/personalized and also need lower internet bandwidth. Some other details on trade-offs can be found [here](http://www.hswsolutions.com/services/mobile-web-development/mobile-website-vs-apps/)

Once the above decisions have been made, it is best to dive into making the product. You could spend endless amount of time planning every single feature and going about making it, but the reality is that customer might not need those features. Hence, customer feedback is essential and the best way to start getting that is to ship out a basic version of the product. 

When it comes to start building, there are two important things – (1) communication and (2) prioritization. Communication with the development team is critical. We learnt important tools like EPICS and user stories (connextra format) that help in communicating the exact nature of the product features to the development team. Its important for the coders to understand the feature completely and ideally there should be no open ends. Once all product features have been communicated, its important to prioritize the creation of these features

For prioritizing its important to think about the core feature and value proposition of the product and start building that first. Once that has been coded, other features can be added. E.g, when building a wedding gift online marketplace, the core features are lists to choose from, reviews and ability to choose and add to a basket. Payment gateway is a secondary feature and can come in later once the user givees feedback on the basic product. If you wait to build out all the features before shipping, it might take too much time. Also, in case you prioritize non-trivial features over the core feature, then you won't have the product ready in time. Even worse could be a situation where you spend months on non-core features to eventually realize that the core product is not good enough to make in the first place. This priority list has to be communicated to the developers.

Finally, a good developer would write as less code as possible. There are various products today that have reduced the headache for many developers. For building online marketplaces, there is shopify and for payments, there is stripe. It is easy to connect to these products through APIs. Hence, as a business manager, you have the ability to really focus on that one thing that you do better than anybody else and you can use other websites/products to help you with the other features that your product offers. 

To summarize, I can break the product creation part into the following steps: (1) understand target customer, (2) think about all features to add and prioritize them, (3) communicate with developers, (4) create a base version of the product, (5) ship out a tightly made base version to customers, (6) get product feedback and finally (7) add/subtract/edit features and then iterate on the product. And always remember, the lesser code you spend time on, the better! Make use of all the amazing products out there already!
