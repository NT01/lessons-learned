One of my key-takeaways from the class was to understand how to think about an online product. A product essentially is an amalgamation of features and when building a product, it is good to write down all the features that you want to have in that specific product. At a very simple level, an e-commerce platform (the example we did in class) is an amalgamation of features like log in page, lists, selection, basket, checkout page, payments, confirmation, reviews etc. An online small business lender could be an amalgamation of features like login page, information, application, document submission, references, signature etc. 

To start building a product, its important to think about the target customer and how the target customer would use that specific product. This helps in figuring out what is the best way to create that product – website, mobile device optimized site or app (platform). Its also important to consider the available budget and the time in which the product has to be released. 

Once the above decisions have been made, it is best to dive into making the product. You could spend endless amount of time planning every single feature and going about making it, but the reality is that customer might not need those features. Hence, customer feedback is essential and the best way to start getting that is to ship out a basic version of the product. 

When it comes to start building, there are two important things – (1) communication and (2) prioritization. Communication with the development team is critical. We learnt important tools like EPICS and user stories (connextra format) that help in communicating the exact nature of the product features to the development team. Its important for the coders to understand the feature completely and ideally there should be no open ends. Once all product features have been communicated, its important to prioritize the creation of these features

For prioritizing its important to think about the core feature and value proposition of the product and start building that first. Once that has been coded, other features can be added. E.g, when building a wedding gift online marketplace, the core features are lists to choose from, reviews and ability to choose and add to a basket. Payment gateway is a secondary feature and can come in later. If you wait to build out all the features before shipping, it might take too much time. This priority list has to be communicated to the developers.

To summarize, I can break the product creation part into the following steps: (1) understand target customer, (2) think about all features to add and prioritize them, (3) communicate with developers, (4) create a base version of the product, (5) ship out a tightly made base version to customers, (6) get product feedback and finally (7) add/subtract/edit features and then iterate on the product.
