Only a few decades ago, the question running ubiquitously across every business owners’ mind was, “Do I need to build a website?” Fast forward to 2015, and it is almost unheard of for any budding business to not have its own website. 

Now, instead of deciding whether or not to build just a website, now business owners are deciding between a website or app. The advice I would give to those faced with this decision, especially after having taken the ‘Digital Literacy for Decision Makers’ course, would be to compare and contrast the benefits of each. 

The benefits of a website are multitudinous. If you’re considering your budget first and foremost (as every new business should be), then look no further than creating a website. Websites are cheaper to build than apps, and also quicker. They require a single build, and there is no versioning. There are also the benefits of findability and linkability. With a website, you might generate more traffic through search engines like Google and others’ will be able to link to your website content. But website builders beware…it is so important to build a website that also works on a mobile device! This is key if you want a successful website, because nowadays we are spending more and more time with our mobile devices. It is also useful to know that even if you build a website first, you can always create an app from it using PhoneGap or Cordova - and it's not hard to do! 

If you don’t want to build a website and would rather consider an app, there are several benefits to this as well.  One word to sum them all up is: Access! With an app, you have greater real estate, meaning since apps are on mobile devices, and mobile devices pretty much live in our palms, you’re app has a greater change of being top-of-mind. Since the app operates on these devices, you’ll also be able to have access to certain features like GPS, camera functions, and your users’ contacts. This information and data can certain enrich your user research and help you to develop a stronger platform. Your app can also be used in places that your audience would be less likely to open a website, like on a long daily commute or in an airplane. The ability to work offline is definitely another ‘plus’ for an app.
