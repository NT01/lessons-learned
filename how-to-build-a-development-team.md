Building a good development team requires a manager to know three things: (1) understanding the problem you are trying to solve and maturity of the business; (2) where to find developers; (3) how to determine the quality of a developer.

First and foremost, when looking to build a development team, one should reflect on the nature of the product being built and the amount of money that can be invested in hiring developers. Generally, before one can decide that the best solution is to hire individuals, the manager should make sure that hiring a company is not a better answer. Hiring a company over individuals could be preferred if the product needs to be completed quickly (i.e. rapid cycle time). By hiring a company, you can often hire a functioning team that can hit the ground running. Second, a company is more likely to complete the work than any given individual. 

If a company isn’t the right answer, hiring a full-time developer is preferred over contracting for a specific project. Depending on whether the front or back-end of the product is most important, the manager should look to hire a developer that is most adept in designing a solution for that side of the product. 

If you can only hire one developer, look to hire a Lead Developer (i.e. somebody with ~2 years of experience) first. When the company can afford a second developer, generally it is next best to hire a Head Engineer (i.e. somebody with ~4 years of experience) that can take control of leading the growing team. 

The next challenge is finding good developers. Possible ways to source talent include doing it through your network (i.e. referrals), going where developers go (e.g., RubyConf), Hacker News and programming blogs, and hiring websites (e.g., 10xmanagement.com, guru.com, rentacoder.freelancer.com, etc.). Additionally, a manager should think about how the company’s mission, technology, and culture could create competitive advantages in attracting talent. 

In general, it is critical that you get along with your lead developer. Additionally, when possible, it is worth trying to keep a development team in the same office for as long as possible. Once an engineering team cannot all be in the same office every day, the domestic a search can be expanded internationally; however, try to keep the team in the same timezone before having a team that works from different timezones. 

Interviews should focus on testing talent and fit first (e.g., work on an 8-10 hour project). Additionally, a manager can get a proxy for how current the developer is by asking him/her about his/her favorite blog and how they stay up to date on XYZ. Lastly, it is important to get a sense of how the person would frame a problem. Often it can be very insightful to ask the interview candidate what they believe will be the hardest part of the problem you are asking them to solve and how they might approach it.
